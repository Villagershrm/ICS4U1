1. What is the difference between the declaration of a class method and that of an instance method?
    The use of the keyword "static" placed before the return type

2. Assume that methods in a class have been declared with the public
modifier. From outside that class, how would we refer to
a) a class method?
b) an instance method?

    ClassName.method()
    ClassName object = new ClassName()
    object.method()

3. Write definitions for the following class methods that could be used in the 
Fraction class.
a) The method product should have two Fraction parameters. It should 
return a value of type Fraction, the product of the parameters passed to 
it.
b) The method abs should have a single Fraction parameter. It should 
return a value of type Fraction in which any negative fields in the 
parameter have been replaced by their absolute values.
c) The method isPositive should have one Fraction parameter. It 
should return a boolean value: true if its parameter represents a 
positive fraction and false otherwise.

4. What is the difference between the declaration of a class field and that of an 
instance field?
    All instanced objects can see a changed class field, but they can only see changes in
        their own instance fields
    
5. Assume the fields in a class have been declared with the public modifier. 
From outside that class, how would we refer to 
a) a class field?
b) an instance field?

    ClassName.field
    ClassName object = new ClassName()
    object.field
