1. If p and q are both variables of type Fraction, under what circumstances 
will the expression p == q have the value true?

    p == q is true if and only if they are pointing towards the same memory address

2. Suppose that p and q are both of type Fraction with p representing 2/3
and q representing 1/6
a) Draw a diagram like those shown in class to illustrate this situation.
b) If the statement p = q; is executed, draw a diagram to illustrate the result.

    p gets assigned to the same memory address located at the address that q points towards.
    This means that modifying q also modifies p, and vice versa.
    p represents 1/6 and q represents 1/6.

3. Write a definition of an equals method for the Fraction class. Your 
method should return true if and only if the Fraction objects being 
compared represent equivalent fractions.

    (Done)

4. Write the toString method for the Fraction class which allows an Fraction 
object to be outputted in the form <num>/<den>, e.g., 2/
