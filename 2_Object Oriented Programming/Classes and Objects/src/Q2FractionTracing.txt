Assume the larger method is declared as followed:
public Fraction larger (Fraction other) {
    if (this.size() >= other.size() ) {
        return this;
    } else {
        return other;
    }
}

public double size() {
    return Math.abs((double)num/den);
}

Suppose that p, q, and r are all objects of type Fraction. What fraction would 
r represent after the statement
    r = p.larger(q);                is executed?
a) p represents 1/3 and q represents 4/5            4/5
b) p represents 7/-5 and q represents -9/-7         7/-5
c) p represents 5/6 and q represents -25/-30        5/6
d) p represents -9/-12 and q represents -3/4        -9/-12
e) p represents 5/8 and q represents 13/20          13/20
